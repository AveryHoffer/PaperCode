This code is part of the supplementary data for the paper "Does height matter? The Embodied impacts of tallness, slab thickness, building code and design tranches." written by Avery Hoffer, Evan Bentz and Shoshanna Saxe from the University of Toronto, Canada. 
How this code is used in collaboration with Altair S-Frame and S-Concrete can be found in the paper. 
This code uses the specific users screen dimension for automation, and therefore may need to be edited to fit a different screen.
